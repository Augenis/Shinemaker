represents the interests of the Polish minority in Lithuania - concentrated in Lithuania’s southeast, around Vilnius. Since 2007, it has had a cooperation agreement with the Russian Union and has established itself as a party representing Lithuania’s Slavic minorities. At times, it cooperates with left-wing governments, and it currently sits in the Skvernelis Cabinet as partners of the LVŽS. For years, it has unsuccessfully tried to ban abortion in Lithuania.<br><br>In the Southeast, the LLRA-KŠS has absolute control and cannot be assailed. It is an affiliate of Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS), but differs in that it is geopolitically pragmatic and is apologist of Putin’s and Lukashenko’s dictatorships. Because of this, they are despised by the Conservatives and Liberals, and their presence in the Skvernelis Cabinet is a headache for the LVŽS.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen2' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LSDDP)</b></li><p>The Social Democratic Labour Party was established in 2018, after members of the LSDP who wished to remain in the Skvernelis Cabinet split from their party following its departure from the coalition. The LSDDP drew much of the party’s old guard and the majority of its parliamentary delegation, but little grassroots support - so, it quickly declined, conceding traditional left-wing voters to the opposition Social Democrats.<br><br>They remain loyal allies of the LVŽS, but the 2020 election campaign leaves the party uncertain of its future. It has also become a home for renegades from the Labour Party, most notably Jonas Pinskus, which has pushed the party to a more socially conservative direction - which may leave them completely overshadowed by the Peasants.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen3' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Centre Party - Nationalists (CP-Taut.)</b></li><p>The Centre Party arose from a split in the Centre Union (which merged into the Liberals) in 2003 by more nationalist minded members of the party. It remained minor until 2016, when it was joined by Naglis Puteikis - former member of the TS-LKD who split in 2014 and ran for President on a populist anti-corruption and soft eurosceptic platform. Puteikis was immediately elected as the party’s chairman.<br><br>In July 2020, it merged with the Lithuanian Nationalist Union and changed its name. It reached a respectable performance with 6% of the vote in 2016 thanks to Puteikis’ name recognition, but his star has faded since. It aims to peel off a small amount of the rural vote and join the next Seimas as an ally of the Peasants.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen4' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: National Alliance (NS)</b></li><p>The National Alliance was established in 2020 by the eurosceptic national conservative philosopher Vytautas Radžvilas - who had unsuccessfully ran for the European Parliament a year earlier with a vow to “reclaim the state”. It is against LGBT rights, immigration and European institution interference in national policy, and it deliberately positions itself against the TS-LKD, which it claims no longer represents conservatism.<br><br>The NS stands out from its right-wing contemporaries by being urban-focused - its voters lean younger than LVŽS and much of its leadership are philosophers and right-wing intellectuals. In this, it can be compared to the early years of the Alternative for Germany, both in leadership and in its opposition to the centre-right. The 2020 election will be the NS’ first test, and though it does not expect to win, it hopes to make a strong showing if the TS-LKD leans too liberal.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen5' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Freedom and Justice (LT)</b></li><p>Freedom and Justice was established in advance of the 2020 election by the “Three Musketeers” - Artūras Zuokas, Artūras Paulauskas and Remigijus Žemaitaitis, leaders of three conservative-liberal political movements which all had fallen on hard times and chose to unify in order to retain their political influence. Of the three, the most prominent was Order and Justice - a personalist political party originally founded by President Rolandas Paksas, and led by Žemaitaitis until 2020.<br><br>It is economically liberal and supports some socially liberal measures such as a compromise option on same-sex partnerships, but generally aligns itself with the conservative electorate. In addition, it holds some eurosceptic and nationalist positions. Though initially a strong contender in the polls, it has fallen to hard times as its voters are increasingly drawn to more potent and active parties.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span><span id='screen6' style='display: none;'><li><b>Name: Lithuanian Green Party (LŽP)</b></li><p>The Green Party was established in 2011 and exists as a small left-wing environmentalist party to this day. It is opposed to nuclear energy and supported the decommission of Lithuania’s only nuclear power plant in Ignalina, it supports green politics, progressive taxation and same-sex partnerships. Most of its voters are in the cities, although it also has attracted several high-profile figures in the regions.<br><br>It does not expect to gain a large share of the vote in the election, but it has one seat it intends to win - Vilkaviškis, where their candidate is former Social Democratic prime minister Algirdas Butkevičius, who defected to the Greens after the LSDP’s split.<br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button></p></span>\", \"color_hex\": \"#00C100\", \"secondary_color_hex\": \"#A1FFA1\", \"is_active\": 1, \"image_url\": \"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/559653590390800384/1147644927841407036/Minors.jpeg\", \"electoral_victory_message\": \"''\", \"electoral_loss_message\": \"''\", \"no_electoral_majority_message\": \"''\", \"description_as_running_mate\": \"''\", \"candidate_score\": 0.0}}]");
