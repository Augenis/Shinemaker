However, I was held back, first by our complex electoral system (that is still inaccurate in this mod - it assumes that proportional and constituency votes are the same, when in fact there's a lot of split-ticket voting), and second by worry that our political system, topics and questions would be too obscure for anyone to be interested to play this.

The Three-Body Problem in Lithuanian Politics'</a></strong></p><h4>Where are they now?</h4><p>So what is the historical result? Who actually won, and what happened to all the characters you can play as?<br><br><strong>The election:</strong> An intense race that started as a seemingly inevitable TS-LKD victory and ended up a nail-biter due to LV≈ΩS recovering in the polls. Still, it was won by the <strong>'Right'</strong>. A coalition of TS-LKD, LRLS and Freedom (so Conservatives and Liberals) was formed and remains the incumbent government.<br><br><strong>The ≈†imonytƒó Cabinet:</strong> Immediately after the election, quarantine was imposed, causing wide controversy. Same-sex partnership law was proposed in the Seimas several times, but has (as of time of writing, September 2023) failed every single time due to opposition from TS-LKD's 'Christian Democrat' wing. The same happened to attempts to decriminalize marijuana. As a result, tensions between TS-LKD and Freedom have mounted and internal conflicts happen almost daily.<br><br>The government's pro-LGBT stance was answered by the formation of a wide anti-LGBT, anti-vaccination and anti-'Right' movement, the Lithuanian Family Movement, which organizes protests and has splintered into several political parties.<br><br><strong>Gabrielius Landsbergis:</strong> After the election, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Under his leadership, Lithuania challenged China over the Taiwan question, leading to a conflict that became international news, and it also became a vanguard of pro-Ukrainian policy in NATO during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, his popularity has plummeted and it is believed that he intends to resign from his party's leadership sometime before or after 2024.<br><br><strong>Ram≈´nas Karbauskis:</strong> After losing the election, he resigned from his parliamentary seat in protest, turned sharply towards anti-LGBT rhetoric and pulled out of the National Agreement on Defense in 2022. His party split - Saulius Skvernelis left in 2021 and established the 'Union of Democrats', a party which intends to be a more moderate continuation of LV≈ΩS' 'statist' economic policy.<br><br><strong>Gintautas Paluckas:</strong> After losing the election, he resigned as chairman in early 2021. A leadership race took place between Juozas Olekas, the candidate of the conservative wing, and Vilija Blinkeviƒçi≈´tƒó - the latter won, and she is the incumbent chairman. She retained some of Paluckas' reform (Gud≈æinskas is one of her vice-chairpeople), but is considered more in the party centre. Under her leadership, thanks to her personal popularity, the party regained its popularity and is now first in the polls. It is widely believed that the Social Democrats will win the 2024 election.<br><br><strong>Plaque of Jonas Noreika:</strong> It's still there.<br><br><strong>Statue to Petras Cvirka:</strong> Removed in 2021.<br><br><strong>The electoral threshold:</strong> The LV≈ΩS attempted to lower it to 3% and received a presidential veto. They failed to overturn the veto by one vote. It is currently still at 5%.<br><br><strong>The National Development Bank:</strong> More or less forgotten, even by the LV≈ΩS itself, even though it was their big agenda in 2020.<br><br><strong>Non-Lithuanian letters in documents:</strong> The language war was finally finished by the ≈†imonytƒó Cabinet. Non-Lithuanian letters in documents have been legalized and society has basically forgotten the question, it is no longer on the agenda.</p><br><br>\", \"has_visits\": 0, \"no_electoral_majority_image\": \"/static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg\"}}]");

The War now consumes much of the nation's attention, and the TS-LKD have placed all bets on the issue, aggressively pushing for defence expansion and anti-Russian rhetoric.

However, the situation in the election is a lot more precarious than it seems. Beyond our loyal base and our Liberal allies, most voters despise the TS-LKD due to our past governments, including Kubilius' management of the Great Recession. At the moment, if we fought one-on-one against the LV≈ΩS, we would lose in most constituencies in the second round. This is what happened in 2016 - even though we got the plurality of the votes, the Peasants got a far larger seat share.<br><br>We must do something to overcome this deficiency. Destroying the prestige of the Skvernelis Cabinet could make runoffs against the LV≈ΩS favorable, if we expect to fight them in most constituencies. Going too liberal could lose us a lot of votes, as we would simply eat into the Liberal parties while losing support beyond our fortress - but if we go too conservative, liberal voters will be much less likely to support us as well.
